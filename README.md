# Capture The Flag

I Would like to share something Iâ€™ve been wanting for a while so I just decided to learn Arduino and do it myself.

Itâ€™s Capture The Flag for your drones (with FPV).
If you happen to stumble here and don't know what FPV is read this first >> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_view_(radio_control) or simply visit my youtube channel YouTube.com/SeekNDFPV

This mod was made with Tiny Whoops (check TinyWhoop.com) in mind but really you can use it with any size drone as long as it has a video transmitter on it.

Itâ€™s fairly easy to build, costs around Â£9 (or $12) per flag in materials and you just need to solder a few cables ðŸ™‚

You can battle 4 drones (blue team) vs 4 drones (red team) in a game of Capture The Flag (as long as your VTX signals allow for that many to be flying at the same time) with as many flags as you are bothered to build!

The code itself is GREATELY based off Chorus RF Laptimer
Visit their repo if you are interested in knowing more about it here: https://github.com/voroshkov/Chorus-RF-Laptimer

Unlike Chorus RF Laptimer, at this moment this mod is standalone and cannot be accessed remotely (yet, maybe someone would like to help code that?)

You can though, change the code to match your needs.
I've commented everything that I've changed in the code with (CC) and the explanation behind it so it's easy for you to find it and replace it. Pretty sure the code can be improved by A LOT but hey .. it's working!
